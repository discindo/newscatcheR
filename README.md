Programmatically collect normalized news from (almost) any website using
R

newscatcheR is an R clone of the python package
[newscatcher](https://github.com/kotartemiy/newscatcher).

The package provides a dataset of news sites and their rss feeds,
together with some characteristics of the websites such as the topic,
country or language of the website, and few functions explore and access
the feeds from `R`.

Two functions that work as a wrapper around
[tidyRSS](https://github.com/RobertMyles/tidyRSS) can be used to fetch
the feed from a given website. Two additional functions can be used to
conveniently browse the websites dataset.

## Installation

You can install the released version of newscatcheR from
[CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org) with:

``` r
install.packages("newscatcheR")
```

And the development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("discindo/newscatcheR")
```

Or

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("discindo/newscatcheR")
```

## Use Case

This package can be convenient if you need to fetch news from various
websites for further analysis and you don’t want to search manually for
the URL of their RSS feeds.

Assuming we have the news sites we want to follow:

``` r
sites = c("bbc.com", "spiegel.de", "washingtonpost.com")
```

We can get a list of data frames with:

``` r
library(newscatcheR)
lapply(sites, get_news)
```
